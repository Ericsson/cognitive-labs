<h1 style="text-align: center;">Who are we?</h1>

Ericsson Cognitive Labs is an initiative powered by a department inside [Cognitive Network Solutions](https://www.ericsson.com/en/portfolio/cloud-software-and-services/cognitive-network-solutions) (which is within the Business Area Cloud Software and Services - BCSS), called Cognitive Software Engineering. In this department, we are focused on the optimization of cellular networks using AI. If you are interested in our products please check this [web page](https://www.ericsson.com/en/portfolio/cloud-software-and-services/cognitive-network--solutions/cognitive-software), and if what drives you here is our publications, check our publications page or our Labs and the initiatives they are pursuing.
