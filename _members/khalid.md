# Khalid M Kahloot

Khalid is a data scientist at Ericson. His strong traits are seniority level, academic record, and teamwork skills. For my seniority level, Khalid has worked for corporates with large-scale businesses my entire career, and he possess competency in software engineering, as well as, data science.

In terms of teamwork skills, for the last 20 years, Khalid has sat on either end of the classroom, i.e.- either learning as a student or teaching as a teacher assistant. Khalid has had tough courses in databases, algorithms, and machine learning and he had an amazing opportunity to supervise extraordinary BS.c and M.Sc. students in their projects and thesis work. In addition, He took part in research projects that lead to regarded publications.

In terms of teamwork skills, Khalid's experience in academia extended to mentoring and supervising multinational students. Khalid has supervised more than 100 students in their Bachelor thesis, Master, and PhD students while he was lucky to work at the Budapest University of Technologies and Economics. Moreover, Khalid has been enrolled in Scrum and Kanban teams since he was a junior developer. Khalid gradually elevated to become responsible for other colleagues in my teams, which assisted in onboarding and ramping them up to speed with the projects. In addition, as a senior, Khalid always finds shortcuts and works around to deal with technical debt.
