# Alvaro Pereira Chagoyen

Alvaro is beginning his journey as a data scientist, embarking on an exciting path filled with opportunities for discovery and innovation. With a strong curiosity and a passion for technology, he is eager to explore the vast world of data and its potential to drive meaningful change. His main focus is to apply artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to tackle complex, real-world problems. At the same time, he recognizes that the success of AI models depends not only on their accuracy but also on their transparency and reliability. Therefore, he places a strong emphasis on the explainability, ensuring that the inner workings of these models are understandable to both technical and non-technical audiences. By prioritizing explainability, he aims to build trust in AI solutions, making them more accessible and acceptable to stakeholders, and ultimately contributing to the responsible and ethical use of data science in society.
