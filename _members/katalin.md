Katalin gained her bachelor’s degree in mathematics in Budapest and her master’s degree in computer science as an EIT ICT Labs student in Trento.
She continued her studies in the Doctoral School of Eötvös Loránd University at the Department of Information Systems. Currently, she is writing her dissertation in the topic of graph neural network interpretability. Her other experiences involve optical character recognition, loan default prediction, detection and classification of sound events and radio network data analytics.
She joined Ericsson in 2023 after a two-year-long collaboration on the topic of graph neural network explainability. Today she is working on performance diagnostics, but she will be joining performance optimizers in the near future.
