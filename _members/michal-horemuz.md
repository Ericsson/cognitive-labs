# Michal Horemuz

Michal studied engineering physics at KTH, followed by a master's in machine learning and a master's in computer science, and now I am a data scientist at GAIA, Ericsson. The projects he has worked on include time series forecasting, classifiers, root cause analysis, large language models and graph neural networks. Currently, he is working on offline reinforcement learning for link adaptation. His main topics of interest are explainability, generative models, and practical usage of ML algorithms. He is also interested in complex systems, and Unreal Engine.
