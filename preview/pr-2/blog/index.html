      <p data-search="Deep learning has grown fast, really fast. It s now a major part of how companies make decisions and design products. With this boom, AI has become more powerful, but also way more complex. One big challenge The explosion of tools and frameworks. We re now living in a world full layers of complexity to build on top of backends1. Diverse frameworks are coexisting such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, MXNet, and more, each with its own quirks and tradeoffs.For machine learning engineers, it s like walking through a forest where every path leads to a different framework, and no one s really sure which one will still exist in five years.So, what s the issue These days, building AI-powered products isn t optional it s expected 2. And as demand grows, so do the tools. The result A tangled mess of components, many of which depend heavily on the framework they re built in. There is no fault to be found as it s natural when a field moves fast, but it s messy and unpractical.You might think, Well, that s just how it goes, but here s the thing: frameworks have a life of their own. And if you ve ever been stuck with a deprecated tool or spent weeks porting models between frameworks, you know how painful that can get. Here s a quick reminder of how these trends have changed over time The Ever-Shifting Framework LandscapeFrameworks aren t static. Some evolve like TensorFlow 2 , others fade away remember Theano , and new ones like JAX pop up with killer features. Each has its own execution style, APIs, and toolchains; and that means a steep learning curve every time you switch.This complexity is a real blocker. In fact, over 90 of companies plan to ramp up their AI investments, but only 1 think their AI capabilities are where they should be. One possible reason Fragmentation at the foundation, in other words, right at the framework level.Different teams want different things. Researchers love PyTorch for fast prototyping. JAX shines in large-scale parallel computing. TensorFlow dominates in production and mobile deployments. And if you re trying to blend open-source models into production systems, it gets even trickier. You end up mixing and matching frameworks, and unfortunetly sometimes within the same product.Why This Hurts More Than You Think When your tech stack is tied tightly to one framework, you run into problems: Lock-in is real. If a library loses support like Theano or shifts direction like TensorFlow 1 to 2 , your whole system might be at risk. Building on top of multi-backend tools gives you some insurance. Best tool for the job Not always easy. Some frameworks do things better than others: physics simulations, distributed training, edge deployments. A rigid stack limits your options. Reproducibility gets tricky. Even porting models between major libraries PyTorch to ONNX, TF to JAX can be a pain. Things like random seeds, execution modes, tensor shapes, or custom gradients often break silently. Deploying models is harder than it should be. AI models don t live in one place. They train in the cloud, run on edge devices, serve millions in real-time. Framework-agnostic formats like ONNX or SavedModel make this easier but only if you design for it. What s the Fix Framework-Agnostic amp; Multi-Framework ApproachesInstead of betting on a single framework, more teams are designing tools and workflows that work across multiple. That s the move: framework-agnostic development. Here s what that looks like: Use high-level libraries that support multiple backends. Think: Keras 3.0. One model definition, works on TensorFlow, JAX, or PyTorch. Model formats like ONNX. Export once, run it wherever. Testing frameworks that compare behavior across libraries. Think: differential testing to catch subtle differences. Interop-focused projects. OpenXLA is a good example : it s a shared compiler backend supported by Google that works across TF, JAX, and now PyTorch via Torch XLA .This shift is happening gradually. PyTorch and TensorFlow are even borrowing ideas from each other. TF2 got eager execution from PyTorch, and PyTorch 2.0 added torch.compile similar to how XLA optimizes graphs in TF or JAX . These aren t just nice features, they re steps toward a shared ecosystem.Examples in the Wild Keras 3.0: Write code once, run on TF, JAX, or PyTorch. ONNX Runtime: Load and run models on anything from CPUs to mobile to cloud GPUs. Hugging Face Diffusers: Train or use generative models with either PyTorch or TensorFlow. Flower: A federated learning framework that abstracts backend differences.But this few examples, are still lacking in comparizon with how big the deep learning ecosystem is becoming, as it can be seen on the snapshot of the open-sourced deep learning ecosystem 3.The snapshot has a big representation of what it is nowadays, but there are even more missing, as example go into one of the three main Frameworks, and look at their own high-level libraries4But It s Not EasyAs great as framework-agnostic sounds, making it work is tough. Different frameworks handle things like tensor ops, devices, or gradients in very different ways. PyTorch is dynamic, JAX is functional and stateless, and TF well, depends on the version. Feature PyTorch TensorFlow JAX Default shape format NCHW NHWC NHWC Device placement Explicit .to device Implicit Graph or .device Functional jax.device put Requires gradient requires grad True tf.GradientTape context jax.grad functional API Mutability Mutable tensors Sometimes mutable Immutable pure functions Randomness Global RNG Graph seed local seed Explicit PRNGKey Writing one model that works across all three Possible, but fragile, complex, and possible very restrictive. PyTorch import torch.nn as nn class TorchModel nn.Module : def init self : super . init self.fc nn.Linear 32, 10 def forward self, x : return self.fc x Tensorflow import tensorflow as tf from tf.keras.layers import Dense class Model tf.keras.Model : def init self : self.fc Dense 32, 10 def call self, x : return self.fc x JAX Flax from flax import nnx class Model nnx.Module : def init self, rngs : self.fc nnx.Linear 32, 10, rngs rngs def call self, x : return self.fc x Teams may decide that they are going to support a multi-framework codebase. But now you re maintaining N versions of the same functionality; that s simultaneous development, testing and deployment needed for N codes. That s a recipe for bugs. Automated testing and good abstractions are a must here, and that still requires more effort.Luckily, tool support is growing5. There s active research into model verification, bug detection, and better conversion tools. As the community embraces this direction, the ecosystem becomes more robust.Where We re HeadedThe ideal A world where ML engineers can write once, run anywhere whether that s on a cloud GPU, an iPhone, or an embedded chip in a robot. We re not fully there yet, but between open compilers like OpenXLA , standardized formats like ONNX , and high-level libraries like Keras 3 , we re getting closer, and as of now hoping for smooth plug-and-play integration regardless of you initial framework selection is a coming step.If your team is building anything meant to last more than a couple of years, thinking about framework-agnostic design early on can save you a lot of pain later. But instead of doing it by yourself, leave this for the open-source frameworks out there. This way, you avoid the problems we talked about before with keeping track of N versions, while we ensure the maintainability in the future thanks to the rich open-source ecosystem.Let s build for the long term even if the frameworks keep changing under our feet.And if this catches your eye, stay tuned for what we ll be releasing in the Cognitive Labs The well known landscape of dependencies for a ML System, Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems, is futher expanded with other papers such as A Taxonomy of Self-Admitted Technical Debt in Deep Learning Systems which found that i there is a significant number of technical debt in all the studied deep learning frameworks. ii there is design debt, defect debt, documentation debt, test debt, requirement debt, compatibility debt, and algorithm debt in deep learning frameworks. iii the majority of the technical debt in deep learning framework is design debt 24.07 - 65.27 , followed by requirement debt 7.09 - 31.48 and algorithm debt 5.62 - 20.67 . In some projects, compatibility debt accounts for more than 10 . 8617; According to Mckinsey global survey on the corporation view of AI, deep learning and artificial intelligence are integrated into at least one business function by 78 of respondents. 8617; As noted by McKinsey sOpen Source in the Age of AI 2023 , around 92 of companies reported that they use open-source software in at least one of their AI initiatives. The survey also highlights that open-source components are increasingly critical not just for research prototyping, but also for production deployments in enterprise settings. The landscap of only deep learning open sourced by Linux Foundation, Open-Source Ecosystem for Machine Learning by the Linux Foundation, but out there exists many more if you go to other libraries layers such as in backends data security ethics model deployment managers. 8617; Examples include: i The ecosystem built over PyTorch: PyTorch Geometric, TorchText, TorchAudio, and third-party libraries like Pyro and Stable Baselines 3 SB3 . ii The TensorFlow ecosystem: APIs like TensorFlow Lite, TFX, TensorFlow.js, and extensions such as TensorFlow Probability, TensorFlow GNN, and TensorFlow Quantum plus projects like Sonnet . iii Other frameworks: Stable Baselines SB3 is building SBX for reinforcement learning with JAX or Google DeepMind s libraries including dm-haiku neural networks , MCTX Monte Carlo tree search , Jraph graph neural networks , and physics simulators like JAX MD. 8617; One recent paper on DL testing Deep Learning Library Testing: Definition, Methods, and Challenges Survey with 93 papers collected from the literature, where 69 are related to DL framework testing, 12 to DL compiler testing and 13 to DL hardware library testing. There exists a recent trend with more papers on this topic. 8617;">
        Deep learning has grown fast, really fast. It’s now a major part of how companies make decisions and design products. With this boom, AI has become more powerful, but also way more complex. One big challenge? The explosion of tools and frameworks. We’re now living in a world full layers of complexity to build on top of backends1. Diverse frameworks are coexisting such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, MXNet, and more, each with its own quirks and tradeoffs.

      <p data-search="It is not new the idea of making a blog so, why now What does it mean And most important, what is this about Six months ago, we released our new initiative to contribute to the open-source community by creating the Ericsson Cognitive Labs. We believed that since we are working in cutting-edge technology, such as Graph Neural Networks or Explainability, our research can benefit the community, having the possibility of applying it in fields such as medicine, autonomous driving, or drug discovery. The idea was bringing these ideas closer to the community and contributing to the open-source ecosystem to give back to the community. However, we have noted that sometimes academic papers, even if they bring an implementation with them, only reach a small audience.To solve that, we have decided to bring a new idea to the table and make a technical blog. Many of you will know for sure the Ericsson Blog, where Ericsson projects are announced and discussed, but here our objective is completely different. As a result, our goal is to make our research more readily available, reaching a larger audience than a paper alone, and creating articles about specific implementations sometimes with significant efficiency savings that might not be appropriate for a journal or conference.More specifically, we plan to add content in the following areas: Bring AI research closer. There may be areas that are not as popular as the famous Large Language Models LLMs , and one can find only little information about them. Moreover, these areas are usually only known in the academic world, with almost no information available outside these types of circles. Our first objective is to provide content about these AI topics, bringing them closer to the public so they can be used by anyone. Deep dive into the software part of our research. We have the feeling that we always share the results of our experiments, which are extensively discussed in our papers, but never about the implementation or how to make research efficient. Even when sometimes we believe that the most interesting part of a problem is how to make it efficient and scalable. Discussion about new technologies and methodologies in the AI industry. We also believe that it may be helpful to be fully open and transparent about what technologies we use, starting new discussions about the possible tech stack and how the industry is evolving. What we have explained is not new, and we have been inspired by amazing companies such as Google DeepMind, Meta FAIR or Modular, and we want to take this idea one level further. Therefore, this will be not only to talk briefly about our projects or new trends but also a new channel to be able to share parts of our research that do not fit into more classic channels, such as conferences or journals. We are happy to share and contribute to this amazing industry. Stay tuned for more">
        To continue our effort to contribute to the open-source community we would like to present the Cognitive Labs Blog, our new channel to communicate about the research we are doing, trying to bring closer our technology to the public.
