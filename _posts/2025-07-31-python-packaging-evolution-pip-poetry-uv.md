### 🐍 **pip vs 🧪 Poetry vs ⚡uv: The Future of Python Dependency Management?**

Python's packaging ecosystem has historically been complex. Developers have had to navigate multiple tools, such as **pip**[^5], **virtualenv**, **pipenv**, and **Poetry**[^3], to manage dependencies, environments, and packaging.

However, a new player has emerged: **uv**[^4], a fast, Rust-based toolset that is quickly changing the way we approach Python project workflows.

In this post, we will explore the unique features of **pip**, **Poetry** and **uv**, helping oneself to determine which tool may be the best fit for respective workflow.

## 🧰 What Are They?

## 🐍 pip

pip is the default package installer for Python. It installs packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and is widely supported and lightweight. While it lacks the advanced dependency resolution and packaging features of tools like Poetry or uv, it's simple, battle-tested, and integrates well with virtual environments created by **venv** or **virtualenv**.

## 🧪 Poetry

Poetry is a comprehensive tool for dependency management and Python packaging[^3]. It works directly with pyproject.toml and simplifies everything from installing packages to publishing to PyPI.

## ⚡uv

uv is a **Rust-powered, ultra-fast tool** designed to replace **pip**, **pip-tools**, and **virtualenv**[^4]. It’s modular, interoperable with existing tools (like **Poetry**), and emphasizes speed and correctness.

### 📦 Installing and Using Libraries with Pip, Poetry, and UV

Installing libraries is the foundation of any Python project. Let's walk through how three popular tools - **Pip**, **Poetry**, and **UV** - handle this process[^1].

### 🐍 Pip - Python’s Default Package Installer

Pip is the most commonly used tool for installing and managing Python libraries[^5]. It’s included with most Python distributions and works well in combination with virtual environments.

## 🔧 Common Pip Commands

<pre> ```bash # Check pip version pip --version # OR (more reliable) python -m pip --version # Install a package pip install requests # Install a specific version pip install "requests==2.18.4" # Install from requirements.txt pip install -r requirements.txt # Upgrade a package pip install --upgrade requests # Uninstall a package pip uninstall requests # Export current dependencies pip freeze > requirements.txt ``` </pre>

🧪 Example: Installing and Freezing with Pip

<pre> ```bash # Install a package pip install requests # Export installed dependencies pip freeze > requirements.txt ``` </pre>

📝 *Tip: Run these commands inside a virtual environment for best practice. See the “Virtual Environment Support” section for setup instructions.*

### 🎼 Poetry - Dependency & Packaging Manager

Poetry simplifies dependency management and packaging by using **pyproject.toml**[^2] as the single source of truth.

🛠️ Poetry Setup and Commands:

<pre> ```bash # Install Poetry (recommended way) pipx install poetry # Or use the official install script curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - # Create a new project poetry new my_project cd my_project # Add dependencies poetry add requests # Install dependencies (from pyproject.toml) poetry install # Update all dependencies poetry update # Remove a dependency poetry remove requests # Run a script inside Poetry’s virtual env poetry run python app.py ``` </pre>

🧪 Example: Installing and Freezing with Poetry

<pre> ```bash # Initialize a new Poetry project (creates pyproject.toml) poetry init # Add a package poetry add requests # Install dependencies (from pyproject.toml) poetry install # Export to requirements.txt (if needed) poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt ``` </pre>

📝 *Tip: Poetry manages a virtual environment automatically. **We** can run commands inside it using poetry shell.*

## ⚡UV -Ultra-Fast Package & Project Manager

UV is a modern Python packaging tool, written in Rust, focusing on speed and compatibility.

🚀 UV Installation & Usage:

<pre> ```bash # Install UV via pip pip install uv # OR with Homebrew (macOS/Linux) brew install astral-sh/uv/uv # Initialize a new project uv init # Create a virtual environment uv venv # Install a package (Pip-style) uv pip install requests # Install from requirements file uv pip install -r requirements.txt # Lock dependencies (like pip-tools) uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt # Sync from lock file uv pip sync requirements.txt # Add a package and install uv add requests # Remove a package uv remove requests # Run script in venv uv run python my_script.py ``` </pre>

🧪 Example: Installing and Freezing with uv

<pre> ```bash # Step 1: Install UV pip install uv # Step 2: Create a new project (adds pyproject.toml) mkdir my-uv-project cd my-uv-project uv init # Step 3: Add and install a package (e.g., requests) uv add requests # Step 4: Freeze dependencies into requirements.txt uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt # Step 5: Run a script within the virtual environment uv run python my_script.py ``` </pre>

*📝** Tip: UV uses the pyproject.toml to manage dependencies and environments.** We **can run any command inside the project's virtual environment using uv run*

## **Virtual environment support with Pip, Poetry, and UV**

Virtual environments are isolated environments that contain a specific Python interpreter, along with its own set of installed packages. They are crucial for managing dependencies, avoiding conflicts, and ensuring reproducibility across Python projects.

Here's how Pip, Poetry, and UV approach virtual environment management:

## 🐍 Pip (Python's default installer)

- Pip itself doesn’t manage virtual environments. Instead, it installs packages in whichever environment is currently active.

- To use a virtual environment with Pip:

<pre> ```bash # Create one with Python’s built-in venv module: python3 -m venv .venv # Activate it: # macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate # Then install packages: pip install &lt;package&gt; ``` </pre>

*🔹** Note: Pip is simple and flexible, but requires manual handling of the virtual environment.*

## 🎼 Poetry (Dependency and packaging manager)
    
- Poetry seamlessly integrates virtual environment management.

- When we run `poetry install` or `poetry add`, it:
  - Creates a virtual environment (usually in a cache).
  - Resolves dependencies.
  - Installs them into that environment.
  
- We can configure Poetry to store the virtual environment inside the project directory (rather than in the global cache) by adding this to your config.toml:
<pre> ```toml [virtualenvs] in-project = true ``` </pre>

- To activate the environment manually:
<pre> ```bash poetry shell ``` </pre>

🔹 *Poetry provides a polished experience with integrated dependency and environment management.*

## 🎼 UV (Ultra-fast Python package manager) 

- UV combines virtual environment creation and package installation into one streamlined workflow.
- To create an environment:
<pre> ```bash uv venv ``` </pre>

- It auto-detects project environments and can also create one with a specific Python version:
<pre> ```bash uv venv ``` </pre>

- UV aims to be a faster alternative to tools like pip, venv, and even Poetry, especially for large dependency trees.

🔹 *Ideal for users who value speed and simplicity in managing environments and packages together.*    
    
## ***🎯 Benchmarking Python Dependency Installation: pip vs Poetry vs uv***

Choosing the right Python tool for dependency management can drastically impact the development speed[^6]. We benchmarked three popular tools - pip, Poetry, and uv - to measure their performance for:
