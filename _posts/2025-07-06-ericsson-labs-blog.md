excerpt: To continue our effort to contribute to the open-source community we would like to present the Cognitive Labs Blog, our new channel to communicate about the research we are doing, trying to bring closer our technology to the public.

It is not new the idea of making a blog so, why now? What does it mean? And most important, what is this about?

Six months ago, we released our new initiative to contribute to the open-source community by creating the Ericsson Cognitive Labs. We believed that since we are working in cutting edge technology, such as Graph Neural Networks or Explainability, our research can benefit the community, having the possibility of applying it in fields as medicine, autonomous driving or drug discovery. The idea was bringing these ideas closer to the community, and contributing to the open-source ecosystem to give back to the community. However, we have seen that sometimes academic papers, even if they bring an implementation with them, only reach a small audience.

To solve that we have decided to bring a new idea to the table and make a technical blog. Many of your will know for sure the [Ericsson Blog](https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog), but in here our objective is completely different. Therefore, our aim with this is to make our research more accessible, reaching a wider audience than just with a paper, and making articles about things as specific implementations (with major saving in efficiency sometimes), that may not fit in a conference or a journal. 

Specifically, we plan to contribute with content in the following areas:

- Bring AI research closer. There may be areas that are not as popular as the famous Large Language Models (LLMs), and one can find only little information about them. Moreover, these areas are usually only known in the academic world, with almost no information available outside this type of circles. Our first objective is to provide content about these AI topics, bringing them closer to the public, so they can be used outside the academic circles.

- Deep dive into the software part our research. We have the feeling hat we always talk about the results of our experiments, which are extensively discussed in our papers, but never about the implementation or how to make research efficient. Even when sometimes we believe that the most interesting part of a problem is how to make it efficient and scalable.
