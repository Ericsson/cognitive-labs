  description: Explainability in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is a new field growing
    in the last few years. In this publication we address the problem of determining
    how important is each neighbor for the GNN when classifying a node and how to
    measure the performance for this specific task. To do this, various known explainability
    methods are reformulated to get the neighbor importance and four new metrics are
    presented. Our results show that there is almost no difference between the explanations
    provided by gradient-based techniques in the GNN domain. In addition, many explainability
    techniques failed to identify important neighbors when GNNs without self-loops
    are used.

  description: Supervised machine learning relies on the availability of good labelled
    data for model training. Labelled data is acquired by human annotation, which
    is a cumbersome and costly process, often requiring subject matter experts. Active
    learning is a sub-field of machine learning which helps in obtaining the labelled
    data efficiently by selecting the most valuable data instances for model training
    and querying the labels only for those instances from the human annotator. Recently,
    a lot of research has been done in the field of active learning, especially for
    deep neural network based models. Although deep learning shines when dealing with
    image\textual\multimodal data, gradient boosting methods...

  description: ESaliency maps have become one of the most widely used interpretability
    techniques for convolutional neural networks (CNN) due to their simplicity and
    the quality of the insights they provide. However, there are still some doubts
    about whether these insights are a trustworthy representation of what CNNs use
    to come up with their predictions. This paper explores how rescuing the sign of
    the gradients from the saliency map can lead to a deeper understanding of multi-class
    classification problems. Using both pretrained and trained from scratch CNNs we
    unveil that considering the sign and the effect not only of the correct class,
    but also the influence of the other classes, allows to better identify the pixels
    of the image that the network is really focusing on. Furthermore, how occluding
    or altering those pixels is expected to affect the outcome also becomes clearer.

  description: This paper presents a method for optimizing wireless networks by adjusting
    cell parameters that affect both the performance of the cell being optimized and
    the surrounding cells. The method uses multiple reinforcement learning agents
    that share a common policy and take into account information from neighboring
    cells to determine the state and reward. In order to avoid impairing network performance
    during the initial stages of learning, agents are pre-trained in an earlier phase
    of offline learning. During this phase, an initial policy is obtained using feedback
    from a static network simulator and considering a wide variety of scenarios. Finally,
    agents can intelligently tune the cell parameters of a test network by suggesting
    small incremental changes, slowly guiding the network toward an optimal configuration.
    The agents propose optimal changes using the experience gained with the simulator
    in the pre-training phase, but they can also continue to learn from current network
    readings after each change. The results show how the proposed approach significantly
    improves the performance gains already provided by expert system-based methods
    when applied to remote antenna tilt optimization. The significant gains of this
    approach have truly been observed when compared with a similar method in which
    the state and reward do not incorporate information from neighboring cells.
